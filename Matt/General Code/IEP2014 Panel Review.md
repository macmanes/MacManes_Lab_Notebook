##Proposal Number: 1423743: IOS Preliminary Proposal: Understanding adaptation to extreme desert environments by integrating genomics and physiology.


####Panel Summary: 

**Synopsis (research goals and approach):**

This study proposes to probe the genetic basis of adaptations for arid environments. Using a nice experimental system, the PI will examine adaptations that promote and regulate electrolyte balance in a model endotherm, Peromyscus eremicus. 

>>Intellectual Merit: 

**Strengths:** 

The Peromyscus eremicus system is appropriate, and the PI has established an ability to work with them. Similarly, the chamber used to manipulate humidity and temperature allows the PI to generate a full complement of challenges to examine the combined or individual effects of these two variables. Exploring the epigenetic effects of the environmental conditions is promising. Also, the approach of integrating physiology and genomics is promising. 

**Weaknesses:**

Because these are endothermic animals, the panel had the presumption that the animals will maintain homeostasis and electrolyte balance. Therefore, the panel would like to see additional data showing that the electrolyte levels or the variance in these levels would change as a result of heat stress which is the focus of the work. The panel notes that the PI did show electrolyte differences in the high humidity-cold challenge(the cool/wet challenge); however, the use of a refractometer to measure electrolytes in urine is not ideal; an osmometer would be better. Additionally, a large part of the study emphasizes genetic work (sequencing), including completion of the genome for Peromyscus eremicus, but the justification for this amount of genetic work is lacking. For example, while the proposed investigation into bisulfite sequencing for methylation state may be a potential strength, the justification for examining this is unclear. Additionally, the panel would like more detail regarding how the physiological data will be integrated with the genomic data. Finally, the panel would like to see the laboratory work corroborated with field sampling. 

>>Broader Impacts: 

**Strengths:** 
Some panel members felt the blog focusing on desert adaptations was interesting. The PI has a great chance of recruiting Native Americans to be involved in internships, therefore broadening participation within his field. 


**Weaknesses:** 

The proposed approach to allow undergraduates to have both directed and undirected research projects was discussed. The panel suggested that undirected research was not ideal and would like to see the PI directly involved. More detail in would help to alleviate this concern. 


>>Rationale for Panel Recommendation: 

Overall, the proposal suffers from a lack of solid physiology. For example, the expectation that there will be electrolyte imbalances, and the use of a refractometer to measure urine characteristics is illustrative of the need to bring in more expertise in this area. The panel suggests the PI consider finding a collaborator with an expertise in osmoregulation in endotherms to assist with the development of the hypotheses and tests. 

The summary was read by/to the panel and the panel concurred that the summary accurately reflects the panel discussion.


**Panel Recommendation: Non-Competitive**

This research will integrate physiological, genomic, and environmental studies to better understand osmoregulation in rodents. There is high potential to advance the knowledge of desert physiological adaptation through this research. This is a young/new investigator with molecular skills capable of deciphering genomic changes that result as a function of dehydration. The concept of looking at genomic and phenotypic variability is great and it appears that this investigator has facilities in which to study this. 

The proposal is written with a lot (too much for me) of jargon. I would like to see the proposal spell out how the data obtained will elucidate phenotypic vs genetic variability. The researcher is quite well published in bioinformatics but not so well published in physiology

The topic is inherently interesting (physiological desert adaptation)and serves as a great springboard for outreach into communities. The researcher has excellent connections with under represented students (Native Americans) through the American Indian Higher Education Consortium. It would seem that the summer internships working on a DIRECTED PROJECT would be inspiring for students. This connection could be extremely useful in recruiting students to UNH. 

**Weaknesses:**

The proposed outreach program for school aged students is not presented in any detail. What exactly will be done? Too vague to determine what the program will be. I am not sure that non traditional modes of research dissemination (preprints, blogs, FB/social media) are effective in public communication and therefore broadening the impacts of the research. It seems that more typically it would be scientists following the social media specific to the research. 





>>Summary Statement 

The proposed work is very interesting and with further refinement of the methods, design and specific aims, this could develop into an exciting and integrative field of osmoregulation. This field of biology would benefit from new technologies that are proposed.

The proposed questions are very specific to aridity adaptation in vertebrates, but identifying adaptations related to electrolyte balance is a critical question in this area, if in fact it represents a hole in current research progress. Unfortunately, the second paragraph in the background section that sets up the importance of this research question is completely lacking in references (as are key passages in the conceptual framework section), making it difficult to evaluate the novelty and importance of the question. I also found the question of ontogenetic changes in electrolyte regulation to be extremely interesting, but this is not even addressed in the background section, and comes in out of the blue in specific aim 3, with no preamble. Finally, in most cases 'transcriptomics' should probably be substituted for 'genomics' to avoid confusion. 

The PI appears to be well set up with rearing/manipulative facilities in the described desert simulation chambers. The proposed manipulations seem appropriate, but it's impossible to evaluate the adequacy of the sample sizes without some comparative preliminary data. The proposed work is a little risky because the PI anticipates seeing limited differences in measured parameters, presumably because of unmeasured physiological differences that maintain homeostasis that should be most obvious when the animals are the most stressed. Are there any preliminary data to show that these treatments strike the balance of providing an adequate stressor while avoiding pathological responses? 

The section on genomics could use more detail on the RNAseq and bisulfite sequencing methodologies. The PI proposes extensive sequencing for genome assembly with very little explanation of why it is necessary. Furthermore, there is almost no mention of why methylation state is potentially important in this system/for this phenotype.

Proposed internship program for Native American students is a strong education component, and the research has good potential to inform medical research into renal disorders. 




**Summary Statement**

This proposal would benefit from better referencing and a focused argument to show that the proposed work will be ground-breaking. More detail is needed on justification for much of the sequence analysis, which as-is tends more towards descriptive rather than hypothesis driven research.

**Strengths:** 
The most compelling argument here is the complexity of the response to water stress is unlikely to reside only in the presence or absence of aquaporins in various membranes, or in single gene studies. This work will look for a suite of changes that might occur presumably by taking a genomic approach RNAseq etc. Most interesting is the ontogentic part (Aim 3), matching ontogenetic changes to genomic changes. 

**Weaknesses:**
 
It is unclear how knowing the genetic mechanisms will alter what we know of the physiological adaptations, what is at stake? Examples? I assume they are homeostatically maintaining electrolyte balance, so you are looking for how this is done? Or are you suggesting they are not in balance, and what you are looking for is how they survive that? These questions arise due to your Aim 1, change temp and water availability then look at changes in various indicators of water stress (and metabolic rate, though reason for looking at that isn't clear). Also, preliminary test examined cool/wet levels and found very different electrolytes, but isn't the question about adaptations to deserts? If so, what does it mean to find differences in a cool/wet trial? Generally, I'd like a few more of these gaps to be filled in, link between treatments and goals aren't solidly explained.
