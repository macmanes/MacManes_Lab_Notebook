Dolphin Review
--

The mauscript by Ruan et al has the potential to be extremely interesting to those of us intersted in understanding the genetic bases of te response to water stress. It is very unfortunate that the study design (necessary secondary to conservation issues) is wholly unable to answer the most interesting questions

1. What was the time between death and tissue recovery. Certainly this could affect your results, as could a prolonged struggle. You could imagine that animals are in shock before death. renal hypo-perfusion will affect patterns of expression as well..
2. Were the libraries made using a stranded or unstranded protocol?
3. Line 227: Where can I access these custom Perl scripts. They should be made available to check for accuracy as well as to enhance reproducibility.
4. Which version of Trinity did you use? 
5. BLASTn itself does not contain an algorithm for reciprocal best blast ID. How did you do this analysis?
6. Could you describe in more detail your RNA quality- possibly providing RIN numbers or bioanalyzer traces? Though above what would be normally required, because your samples came from deceased individuals there is a specific cause for concern. 
7. For KaKs\_Calculator, how did you generate the ATX formatted input file. What settings did you use for running KaKs_Calculator?
8. What specifically did you use as your input to DESeq? RPKM, count data, something else?
9. There is absolutely no way you can distinguish noise from signal in your experiment, given that you have n=1 for both. Even in a perfectly controlled experiment this would be the same. You're design is unfortunately not perfect, given the animals were deceased, different ages, different sex, different reason for death, different time between death and tissue collection. Any of these could result in differences in expression. 
10. I am not knowledgable in the field of immunohistichemistry, so I cannot comment on these methods. 
11. Are the assembled contigs deposited anywhere. They have to made available to the reviewers and readers. 
12. I'm not sure I understand Table 3. Do the numbers listed correspond to the number of transcripts contained in each Kegg group?
13. How did you find coding sequence, e.g. line 151?
14.
